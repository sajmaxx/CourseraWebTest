                My favorite food is chinese food for two reason.
                First of all, I like noodles because they are soft and they have a delicious soup on it. 
                In the noodle, you can put a spicy sauce to add flavor. 
                Next, I like chow fun because it is very oily. <br>
                Chow fun is fun to eat because you can stack it up and stab it with your chopstick. 
               </p>
